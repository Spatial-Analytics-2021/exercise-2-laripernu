# Exercise 2

The purpose of this exercise is to:
 
1. provide you experience in working with Python and the [`pysal` library](https://pysal.org/) that is one of the core libraries for spatial analysis in Python 
2. teach you how to conduct spatial autocorrelation analysis using real statistical data from Finland
3. deepen your understanding of different concepts that relate to spatial autocorrelation


## Programming assignment (20 points)

## Grading

**Points:**

- Problem 1: 7/7 points
- Problem 2: 7.5/8 points --> In step 8, the question "why is it important to know whether there is spatial autocorrelation" also relates to assumptions that some of the classic statistical methods have: i.e. the observations should be independent from each other.  
- Problem 3: 4/4 points
- Problem 4: 1/1 points

**Total: 19.5/20 points**
