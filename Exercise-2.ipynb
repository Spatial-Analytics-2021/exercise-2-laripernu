    "\n",
    "Exercise 2 includes four problems that you need to solve with programming, and by providing answers to questions. For each problem you need to modify the notebook by adding your own solutions. Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change! Regular commits will help you to keep track of your changes (and revert them if needed). Pushing your work to GitHub will ensure that you don't lose any work in case your computer crashes (can happen!).\n",

    "This exercise should be returned to your personal Github repository within **two weeks** after the first practical session (by Wednesday 23:59). Please notice that finishing the programming exercises can take significant amount of time (especially if you don't have yet much programming experience). Hence, **it is recommended that you start immediately working on them**.\n",

    "7. Re-project the data back to WGS84 (EPSG:4326) and create an interactive map showing the population density in Helsinki Region. For doing the interactive map, you can use a method `data.explore(\"pop_density_km2\"`). As a result, you should get something like below:\n",

Create the weights based on the data GeoDataFrame using Queen contiguity and store the resulting weights into a variable `w`. For creating the spatial weights, you can use the weights submodule from pysal library (see docs). If you need further information, we also recommend checking [chapter 4](https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/04_spatial_weights.html) from \"Geographic Data Science with Python\" book (Rey et al. forthcoming). \n",
